# PawPals
Thank you for checking out my first completed project using HTML/CSS and vanilla JS.
Just a couple things before you continue to check out the project!

Within PawPals I utilized -

-The vanilla javaScript used in Pawpals utilizes dynamically added and interactive text and objects. <br>
-Locally stored user data including the ability to edit and overwrite the data.<br>
-API (most importantly the interactive dog park map)<br>
-NONE of the sign up data is stored anywhere other than locally to your device. Feel free to sign up and experience the full features!


This is my first "large" project showcasing my ability to use and understand JS. <br>

Please let me know what you think as I continue my software development journey. <br>
